# Fady ~
*A simple cross fade plugin.*
Allows you to handle cross fades with a single image and minimal markup.

+ Image must be twice the desired height (normal state over hover state)

```js
$(function(){
  $('.fade').fady();
});
```

## Coming soon
+ Better image loading
+ Better control over positioning
+ Loading via data-*
+ Reduction of markup
+ and more stuff...
